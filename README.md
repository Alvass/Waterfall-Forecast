## Summary
Tool to check if orders were placed at production lead time minimum.

## Situation
Customer experienced several production stop with the last 6 months and correction actions was urgently needed to support their business

## Task
I run a root cause analysis and the waterfall forecast tool was part of the visual used

## Action
For each critical part numbers, I collected information on when orders were submitted to us and look if it was validated within our production lead time.  

## Result
The tool identified several orders placed at a shorted lead time due to sudden demand increase, an order with a validated RFQ and a couple of orders validated weeks later due to invoices paid late.
This has enable the sales engineer to open the discussion with the customer about a logistic program to compensate any variation in production demand, the setup of a 6 months price list and a review of their payments terms from 60 days to 30 days end of month so invoices can be paid on time more accurately.
